# TLV Rust

> [Type-Length-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value)

Within data communication protocols, TLV (type-length-value or tag-length-value) is an encoding scheme used for optional information element in a certain protocol.

The type and length are fixed in size (typically 1-4 bytes), and the value field is of variable size. These fields are used as follows:

**Type**

A binary code, often simply alphanumeric, which indicates the kind of field that this part of the message represents;

**Length**

The size of the value field (typically in bytes);

**Value**

Variable-sized series of bytes which contains data for this part of the message.
